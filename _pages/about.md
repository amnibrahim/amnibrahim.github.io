My research focuses on natural language processing and computational social science, particularly adressing online toxicity like hate speech and abusive language on social media.

I hold a master's in Data Science from Lancaster University. There, I worked with industry partner [GBG](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gb-group) to analyze and classify company websites based on their business domains, helping identify potential clients. This work was supervised by [Azadeh Khaleghi](https://azalk.github.io/), with industry mentorship from [Ian Hopkinson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianhopkinsonchester/).
