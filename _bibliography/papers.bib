  abstract = {The increasing amount of content on social media content makes the use of automatic moderation crucial for preserving a healthy online community and reducing the spread of offensive and abusive content, such as hate speech based on gender. Developing automated social media moderation using machine learning demands a large and balanced dataset. However, difficulties such as data scarcity and class imbalance have hindered the development of gender-based hate speech detection on Indonesian Twitter communities. Creating and annotating a new dataset would be time-consuming and costly. One practical alternative is to use data augmentation methods to help address the minority class imbalance in datasets. This study investigates how prompt-based data augmentation may be used with a large language model to provide organic tweet samples for gender-based hate speech detection. Furthermore, the study investigates the preservation of labels in augmented Twitter samples. In comparison to the benchmark back translation approach, the results show that prompt-based data augmentation using a large language model may generate new and organic Twitter samples while keeping labels preserved and avoiding memorization. In conventional machine learning models, prompt-based data augmentation with a large language model shows competitive performance compared to back translation in terms of accuracy metrics. According to these results, using prompting for data augmentation on large language models is an alternative strategy that can provide new, less memorization tweet samples that maintain label integrity while achieving competitive accuracy results.},

  abstract = {Social media moderation is a crucial component to establish healthy online communities and ensuring online safety from hate speech and offensive language. In many cases, hate speech may be targeted at specific gender which could be expressed in many different languages on social media platforms such as Indonesian Twitter. However, difficulties such as data scarcity and the imbalanced gender-based hate speech dataset in Indonesian tweets have slowed the development and implementation of automatic social media moderation. Obtaining more data to increase the number of samples may be costly in terms of resources required to gather and annotate the data. This study looks at the usage of data augmentation methods to increase the amount of textual dataset while keeping the quality of the augmented data. Three augmentation strategies are explored in this study: Random insertion, back translation, and a sequential combination of back translation and random insertion. Additionally, the study examines the preservation of the increased data labels. The performance result demonstrates that classification models trained with augmented data generated from random insertion strategy outperform the other approaches. In terms of label preservation, the three augmentation approaches have been shown to offer enough label preservation without compromising the meaning of the augmented data. The findings imply that by increasing the amount of the dataset while preserving the original label, data augmentation could be utilized to solve issues such as data scarcity and dataset imbalance.},
